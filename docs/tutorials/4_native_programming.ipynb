        "When working with quantum circuits, you'll encounter situations where you need your code to run exactly as written, without the compiler making any \"helpful\" optimizations. Think of it like this: imagine you're following a precise recipe where every step matters, and you don't want someone rearranging your ingredients or skipping steps they think are unnecessary. This is where verbatim compilation becomes essential. There are several compelling use cases: when benchmarking quantum hardware, you need precise control over which specific gates execute on the device since any compiler optimizations could introduce variables that make your performance measurements meaningless. In error mitigation protocols, you might need to insert what looks like redundant operations that a smart compiler would normally remove, but these \"extra\" steps are actually crucial for techniques like zero-noise extrapolation to work properly. For quantum error correction, the exact placement and timing of gates is critical for syndrome extraction and correction operations to work efficiently. Additionally, calibration and characterization experiments require verbatim execution because you're often testing specific gate implementations or noise properties that would be obscured if the compiler substitutes different gates. Advanced quantum protocols like dynamical decoupling or composite pulse sequences also need precise timing and gate ordering preserved exactly as programmed to maintain their effectiveness. To prevent the compiler from modifying your circuits, you can use AWS Braket's #pragma braket verbatim directive around the critical sections of your OpenQASM code, or if you're using the Qiskit-Braket provider, simply set verbatim=True in your backend's run method to tell the system \"hands off â€“ run this exactly as I wrote it.\""
